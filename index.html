        <h3 class="heading">Field Trips</h3>

        <pre class="para">Day trips to locations in the Wellington region are usually held on the first Saturday of each month.   Extended excursions are usually held at New Year, first weekend in February and Easter.

        The following programme is SUBJECT TO CHANGE.   If you wish to join a Saturday trip, please tell the trip leader on the Thursday p.m. at the latest, or if you wish to join an over-night trip, please tell the trip leader on the Wednesday p.m. at the latest, so that the leader can:
        ~   contact our hosts, if we are visiting a private area, to confirm the visit
        ~   print enough copies of a plant species list, if one has been prepared for the site.

        Remember the weather can be changeable on field trips.   Sun hat, balaclava, waterproof / windproof parka, may all be used on a day trip.

        Non-members are welcome to join us on our field trips.</pre>

        <h3 class="heading">Meetings</h3>

        <pre class="para">BotSoc meetings are usually held at 7.30 pm on the third Monday of each month at Victoria University, Wellington, Lecturer Theatre M101, ground floor Murphy Building, west side of Kelburn Parade.   Enter building off Kelburn Parade about 20m below pedestrian overbridge.

        Non-members are welcome to come to our evening meetings.

        To Help raise funds for BotSoc’s Jubilee Award Fund members are encouraged to bring named seedlings/cuttings for sale at each evening meeting.</pre>

        <h3 class="heading">Upcoming Meetings</h3>

        <pre class="para-head">Monday 21 September:   Evening meeting – Tony Druce Memorial Lecture “Relationships and the battle to save the Raukumara Range”</pre>

        <pre class="para">Speaker:   Graeme Atkins: DOC Biodiversity Ranger, East Cape / Ruatoria.   His talk will be about relationships.   A relationship was lost between our Raukumara and the tangata whenua who have lived in and around their forest for centuries.   Their reliance, to use contemporary terminology, on the many services provided, has diminished considerably, when compared with former times.   Pharmacy, supermarket, clothing store, hardware store, timber mill, cultural needs and the arts, all were once sourced from their Raukumara.   That connection has been lost.   They now find the present situation where the degradation of their Raukumara has occurred because of too many introduced animals.   Because of this disconnect, no one had witnessed the damage, caused mainly by red deer and possums.   Relationships feature again in the battle to turn things around for our Raukumara.   Attend the talk to find out more.</pre>

      <pre class="para-head">Highlights from Greater Wellington’s (GW’s) Annual Report 2009/10</pre>

      <pre class="para">The following achievements reported in GW’s Annual Report are very encouraging:

        •   The regional parks network will be expanded by the purchase of 284 ha at Baring Head (a joint initiative with DOC, Nature Heritage Fund, HCC and a private benefactor).

        •   Seventeen new landowners joined the Wetlands Incentive Programme during the year, bringing the total number of landowners in the programme to 157.

        •   Nineteen properties are now included in the Pauatahanui Inlet Action Plan; the landowners contribute financially and in kind.   Achievements included fencing (3.3 km) to help protect wetlands and the lower Kakaho and Horokiri streams.   Seven thousand indigenous plants were also planted in winter 2010.

        •   GW support for six QEII National Trust Covenants will, when finalised, protect about 65 ha of lowland indigenous forest and wetland.   Pest control activities were also carried out on an additional seven registered covenants.

        •   Staff developed a Freshwater Ecosystems Action Plan.

        •   The public were consulted on a draft Parks Network Plan, and the Parks Network Strategy was approved.

        •   Implementation of the Coastal Ecosystem Action Plan continued with the preparation of foredune restoration plans for five beaches and estuaries, and fencing of more dunes in collaboration with local councils and landowners.

        •   Site-led plant pest control programmes were carried out at 55 Key Native Ecosystems (KNEs) and reserves.   Active pest animal control was carried out at 90 sites (19,624 ha) comprising 34 private sites and 56 reserves.

        •   Post-operation monitoring of the Hutt River catchments after an aerial possum control operation did not detect any surviving possums in the treated area.

        •   A framework for determining the survival rate of trees planted across the network has been drafted and will be trialled, finalised and carried out in 2011.

        •   The Regional Policy Statement under the Resource Management Act was approved.

        •   GW also took part in the Ministry of Society Development’s Community Max Scheme which aims to upskill young unemployed people.   This enabled GW to employ 15 extra staff who worked on more than 50 biodiversity enhancement projects at very little cost to GW.

        •   GW also deserves credit for reporting in a way that shows the actual results and expenditure against the planned activities/targets and budgets.

      <pre class="para-head">New research: Secondary Chemistry Expression in Senecio</pre>

      <pre class="para">Every species has a natural suite of enemies (predators, parasites, diseases) that has co-evolved with it in the context of its indigenous range.   Some species, upon being transported outside their indigenous range exhibit rapid spread and high densities and become regarded as invasive aliens.   The enemy release hypothesis (ERH) suggests that one of the reasons for the success of invasive alien species is their escape from their natural enemies upon their arrival in a new environment.   Indeed this has been demonstrated in a number of studies, but is by no means a universal explanation for those species apparently performing better in their adventive range compared to their indigenous range.

      One of the ways in which plant species can defend themselves against herbivorous enemies is the production of secondary metabolic compounds which diminish the palatability of plant tissue (e.g., tannins, alkaloids, phyto-oestrogens).   This raises the potential for examining evidence for the ERH by measuring the expression of these compounds under various conditions – for example indigenous and adventives species within and without their native range.   We proposed to embark on such a study for New Zealand weeds using the genus Senecio as the subject.   A number of species of the genus have been shown to produce pyrrolizidine alkaloids known to be anti-herbivory compounds – perhaps the most studied being S. jacobaea (now Jacobaea vulgaris, but we’re not too fussy in this context).   However, this is not a trivial task, as the range of secondary compounds and their various chemotypes is enormous – the investigations into ragwort have a basis in decades of investigation of the chemistry.   Extending such investigations to other invasive species presents some challenges but new developments in chemical analytical technologies and new approaches to the analysis of complex chemical profiles offer powerful tools for untangling the web.

      In the first instance, we propose to chemically screen different populations of a range of Senecio spp. to address the hypothesis “If the invasive nature of a naturalised population of a plant species is primarily due to its defensive chemistry, the range of chemotypes in the invasive zone should show uniformity compared to the diversity in its natural range where adapted specialist herbivores provide a countervailing selective pressure.   Conversely if the features favouring invasion are not primarily phytochemical, in principle the range of chemotypes in the invasive and natural range should not differ”.

      To do this we have begun to compare the chemical profiles of different populations of a range of invasive Senecio spp. in New Zealand.   So far we have looked at S. angulatus, S. elegans, S. glastifolius, S. mikanioides (a.k.a. Delairea odorata, but remember we’re not fussy!) and S. skirrhodon.   Preliminary analysis of the chemotype profiles do indicate a degree of uniformity within spenbsp; We would be pleased to hear from any Wellington BotSoc members who can help us locate populations of Senecio spp. that we could sample for our studies.
